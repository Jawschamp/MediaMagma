# Welcome to MediaMagma

# What is MediaMagma

- MediaMagma is like Plex where you control the content you see you can make catogoris for (e.g: Music, Tv Shows, Movies, Games) There is no limit to what you can do with MediaMagma

# How do I add my "Content" to Media Magma
- Glad you asked.... to add content you must specify to MediaMagma what [Folders] are for media there's a tutorial in the app if you need it :)

# Categories are great but how will I launch a game?
- MediaMagma at the moment does not have plans to replace an existing real Launcher (for eg: the Epic Games Launcher) will be the default thing to launch your games, but we are always attempting to make MediaMagma better in any way possible
